Hi! I’m Anthony Gunadi, the composer of Titan. The Ableton project file includes the electronic track, click track, and effects automation. The score is included in the folder too. Thank you for your interest in performing this piece!

IMPORTANT: If you have any questions or need assistance, do not hesitate to email me at anth.gunadi@gmail.com. I would also be happy to listen in on a rehearsal, help promote your performance, and possibly attend in person!

Ableton Project Information
* Click Track:
    * A mono click is routed to Channel 3.
    * This should not be heard through the main speakers (Channels 1/2).
    * There is a 2-BAR COUNT-IN. Bar 1 of the score = Bar 3 in Ableton.
* Processing:
    * Set the input of the “Processing” track as your microphones.
    * This track automates the volume of the delay and distortion effects.
    * There is an EQ to cut the lows and unpleasant frequencies; adjust this based on your particular instrument.
    * Its output is set to SENDS ONLY, so your dry signal is not amplified through the speakers (the car muffler on its own is already very loud).
* Before Bar 1:
    * At the very beginning of the project (2 bars before the start), the delay effect is active; you may use this to do a dramatic reading of the program note before starting (this is optional, Jeffrey Zhu does this in his performances).
* Effects:
    * Found in the send tracks.
    * Distortion uses Fabfilter Saturn, but you may substitute another plugin if unavailable.
* Other:
    * Please adjust the track levels and effects levels as needed for your venue (volume automation has been customized for Walter Hall, University of Toronto.)
    * There is a limiter on the master track to prevent clipping.
    * Use the “Recording” audio track to record your playing. This track has no other function and may be deleted if not needed.
    * The track “Automation Backup” contains the original effects automation lines in case you need to revert back to them.
